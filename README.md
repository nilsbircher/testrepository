# Introduction to a DApp 

The goal of this overview article is to retain my path from having almost no experience with Blockchain Applications, especially from a technical point of view, to having some idea. If one has already been in touch with the technology several chapters can be skipped ahead as it starts with the very basics about a blockchain. 
The focus will be on setting up / developing a DApp based on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 1) Blockchain - Basics

A blockchain is a public record of transactions which is saved in a distributed manner. Hence, there are many instances of the database saved on a multitude of computers. The real change the first blockchain projects brought is how an agreement is formed to decide upon the valid version of the database and how new transactions are handled and added to the database.
